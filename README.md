Converts grayscale images between two representations: 8-bit unsigned integers (0-255) and double-precision floats (0.0-1.0). The program integrates C for input handling, memory management, and output display, while leveraging x86-64 assembly for optimized conversion using scalar SIMD registers and instructions.
